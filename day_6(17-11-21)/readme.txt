events are "things" that happen to html element when javascript is used in html pages, javascript can "react" on these events.

An Html event can be something the browser does,or something a user does.

javascript lets you execute code when events are detected .


conclusion :-
this is because addeventlistener does not overwrite event handlers, whereas onclick overrides any exxisting onclick = function event handlers.

the other difference ,of course is that onclick wil always work, whereas addeventlistener doesnot work in internet explorer before version 9.



timing based events **********

the window object allow execution of code at specified time intervals
these time intervals are called timig events .
